                        <p>In this conference, I talked about using artificial intelligence in software testing, particularly the ChatGPT model by OpenAI. By exploring experiment use cases, I unpacked how ChatGPT could be used in software testing, improving efficiency. I presented the outcomes of these cases, detailing the positive impacts and any challenges encountered along the way. Moreover, I examined the broader implications of using AI in software testing, shedding light on its potential for the future.</p>
